  <h2>Add a new League</h2>
  <p>Complete the form below to request a new league. The request must be approved by an administrator before it will be visible. Once the league has been created, you will be set as the organiser.</p>
  <p>If you set the league to be public, anyone can join the league.</p>
  <p>The default setting is private which means you, as the administrator, will need to manage any requests to join the league. You will see a list of all requests on your home page.</p>
